I'm a contract web & software developer in London, UK. I have a full-stack experience -- from PHP/Java/Node/Ruby backends, to HTML5/Angular/CanJS frontends, to Puppet/AWS/Linux dev-ops, to Android apps and browser extensions.

I enjoy using Angular JS, Node, PHP, Symfony 2 and Play framework, and writing well-tested code.
