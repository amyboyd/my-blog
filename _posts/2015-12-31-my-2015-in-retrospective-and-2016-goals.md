2015 retrospective
==================

2015 was a good year for my programming life, but a pretty bad year for my personal life.

**Programming langages used**

* PHP - wrote two big PHP applications, mainly with the Symfony2 framework.
* Javascript with ES6 - wrote loads of Javascript, for web (mainly AngularJS), for mobile (Ionic), for server tasks (Node), and for browser extensions.
* Puppet - for server provisioning.
* Scala - a newly learned language that I've used in several side projects, and I've really loved using it.
* Go - a newly learned language.
* Bash.
* There are languages that I used to use often, but haven't used in 2015, so my knowledge will have gone stale, like Java and Ruby. For Java, this is OK because there are better JVM-targetted languages like Scala. For Ruby, this isn't OK.

2016 goals
==========

**Programming languages I want to use**

* More Scala - I've fell in love with this language.
* More Go - although I'm not sure I'll have the chance to use it in any major way.
* Less PHP - using the same language for years gets old.
* No Java - Scala and other JVM languages should be used instead.
* Hack (Facebook's language based on PHP).

**Reading list**

* [Programming Scala](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033073.do)
* [Scala Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026914.do)
* [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
* [Nontechnical Guide to Petroleum Geology](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nontechnical-Petroleum-Exploration-Drilling-Production/dp/1593702698)

**Other goals**

* Do my taxes as soon as possible, instead of waiting until the last minute.
* Write 1 blog post every 3 months.
